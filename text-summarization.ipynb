    "In this code, we first load the NLTK library and the stop words for English. We then define the text that we want to summarize and tokenize it into sentences using the sent_tokenize() function. Next, we create a frequency table for the words in the text using a defaultdict() object from the collections module. We iterate through each sentence, tokenize it into words, and count the frequency of each word, excluding stop words.\n",

    "We then calculate a score for each sentence by adding up the frequencies of its constituent words. We use another defaultdict() object to store the sentence scores. Finally, we select the top N sentences based on their scores and print them as the summary.\n",
